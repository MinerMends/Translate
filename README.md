✔ Calculator: it works fully, still need to make a Readme with usage samples...

✔ Misc*: a bunch of random commands that I need in my personal guild!!

on-message: not working, I'll fix it eventually ;P

Starboard2: have to fix so it uses db correctly

✔ Translate: fully working, a very old cog from another abandoned project... rip

Prediction: still in the process of being converted from old cog to Modmail-plugin (8ball, oracle, tarot)

✔ Timezone: made this one because members from all over the world get confused about timezones for events, smh

Games: need to add 'em here... because reasons...

Presence: there's already a command that works, but I might add one to loop a list of presence statuses
